                    <h3>Candy Is The Reason For The Season</h3>
                    <p>Halloween has come a long way from its origins. 
                       These days, it is a vehicle for children to obtain mountains of candy in a sigle night. 
                       Parents also join in this endeavor and sometimes levy a "candy tax" on the take. 
                       Wholesome fun to be sure even if it is hard on the teeth.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>I share Jay Leno's thoughts on the subject:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>My favorite Halloween candy is the candy corn.</p>
                        <p>It comes in four colors: white, yellow, orange, brown. Those are also the stages of your teeth rotting after you eat it.</p>

                    <h3>Who Is That Masked Man?</h3>
                    <p>Dressing up isn't just for the kids, either. About a quarter of adults in the US dress up as well.</p>

                    <p>I plan on getting in on the fun this year as well. Some friends and I are going to revisit some characters we dressed up as when we were kids. With the recent release of Ghostbusters, we decided to dust off the old proton packs and look for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.</p>
